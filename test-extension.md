# Testing the Auto-Logout Extension Tab Closing Fix

## What was fixed:

1. **Background Script (`background.js`)**:
   - Fixed the `handleCloseBlockedTabs` function to properly identify the current active tab
   - Now closes all blocked tabs EXCEPT the current one immediately
   - After 0.1 seconds, closes the current tab along with all empty/new tabs
   - Ensures at least one new tab remains open for the user
   - Added better error handling and logging

2. **Blocked Page (`blocked.html`)**:
   - Added visual feedback when the "Back to work" button is clicked
   - Button shows "Closing tabs..." while processing
   - Better error handling with user feedback

3. **Content Security Policy (CSP) Fix**:
   - Moved inline script from `blocked.html` to external `blocked.js` file
   - Eliminates CSP violation that was blocking script execution
   - Ensures the extension works properly in Chrome's secure environment

## How to test the fix:

### Step 1: Load the extension
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `auto-logout` folder
4. The extension should appear in your extensions list

### Step 2: Trigger the blocked page
1. Set a very short time limit (like 5 seconds) in the extension options
2. Visit one of the tracked sites (facebook.com, instagram.com, etc.)
3. Wait for the time limit to be reached
4. You should see multiple tabs redirect to the blocked page

### Step 3: Test the "Back to work" button
1. Click the "Back to work" button on any blocked page tab
2. **Expected behavior**:
   - Button should show "Closing tabs..." briefly
   - All other blocked page tabs should close immediately
   - After 0.1 seconds, the current tab and all empty/new tabs should be closed automatically
   - A new tab will be opened to ensure the user has somewhere to go
   - Console should show success messages

### Step 4: Verify in console
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Look for messages like:
   - "Found X blocked page tabs to close: [tab_ids]"
   - "Current active tab ID: [tab_id]"
   - "Successfully closed tab [tab_id]"
   - "Adding current tab [tab_id] to cleanup list" (after 0.1 seconds)
   - "Found X tabs to close (empty + current): [tab_ids]"
   - "Successfully closed tab [tab_id]"
   - "Closed X tabs (empty + current)"

## Expected Results:
- ✅ All blocked page tabs close except the current one immediately
- ✅ After 0.1 seconds, the current tab and all empty/new tabs are automatically closed
- ✅ A new tab is opened to ensure the user has somewhere to go
- ✅ No error messages in console
- ✅ Button provides visual feedback during operation

## Troubleshooting:
If the fix doesn't work:
1. Check the console for error messages
2. Verify the extension has the "tabs" permission in manifest.json
3. Make sure you're testing with multiple blocked tabs open
4. Try reloading the extension if changes aren't taking effect

### CSP-Related Issues:
If you see Content Security Policy errors:
1. Ensure `blocked.js` is in the same directory as `blocked.html`
2. Check that the script tag in `blocked.html` correctly references `blocked.js`
3. Verify no inline scripts remain in any HTML files
4. Reload the extension after making CSP-related changes
